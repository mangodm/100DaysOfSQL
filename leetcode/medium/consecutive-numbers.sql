-- Question 180. Consecutive Numbers

-- Table: Logs

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | num         | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key for this table.
-- id is an autoincrement column.
 

-- Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The query result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Logs table:
-- +----+-----+
-- | id | num |
-- +----+-----+
-- | 1  | 1   |
-- | 2  | 1   |
-- | 3  | 1   |
-- | 4  | 2   |
-- | 5  | 1   |
-- | 6  | 2   |
-- | 7  | 2   |
-- +----+-----+
-- Output: 
-- +-----------------+
-- | ConsecutiveNums |
-- +-----------------+
-- | 1               |
-- +-----------------+
-- Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

-- Solution
WITH is_consecutive_list AS (

    SELECT
        num,
        CASE
            WHEN num = LEAD(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AND num = LEAD(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) THEN 1 
            ELSE 0
        END AS is_consecutive
    FROM Logs

)

SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM is_consecutive_list
WHERE is_consecutive = 1;
